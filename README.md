The Student Grade Analyzer is a Python application designed to improve grade management and performance analysis in educational environments.This tool uses object-oriented programming to provide educators with a
comprehensive solution for tracking student academic achievement. With the ability to view, add, and modify grade entries for a variety of subjects and assessment formats, the system lets users keep track of student
grades in a database. Beyond simple data management, the analyzer determines academic accomplishment trends, including identifying high-achieving students, and computes performance indicators like average grades.
This application's reporting capabilities is a crucial component that uses statistical analysis and summary reports to turn raw grade data into insightful knowledge. These reports assist teachers in recognizing patterns
and choosing the best teaching strategies. The Student Grade Analyzer addresses a real requirement in educational and administration while showcasing the practical application of programming ideas through the implementation
of fundamental OOP concepts.
