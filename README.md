# Student Grade Analyzer

Student Grade Analyzer System is designed to simplify the evaluation of student grades across multiple subjects. It collects and analyzes grade data, producing important statistics including distributions, averages, and trends. To help teachers better understand student performance and identify areas for development, the system will also generate visual representations of this data. This will improve learning results overall.

## Overview

The Student Grade Analyzer is a Python application designed to improve grade management and performance analysis in educational environments. This tool uses object-oriented programming to provide educators with a comprehensive solution for tracking student academic achievement.

With the ability to view, add, and modify grade entries for various subjects and assessment formats, the system allows users to maintain a structured database of student grades. Beyond simple data management, the analyzer identifies academic performance trends, such as recognizing high-achieving students, and computes performance indicators like average grades.

A key feature of this application is its reporting capabilities, which utilize statistical analysis and summary reports to transform raw grade data into insightful information. These reports help teachers recognize patterns and determine the best instructional strategies.

The Student Grade Analyzer addresses a real need in education and administration while demonstrating the practical application of programming principles through fundamental OOP concepts.
