## Overview
The Student Grade Analyzer is a Python application designed to improve grade management and performance analysis in educational environments. This tool uses object-oriented programming to provide educators with a comprehensive solution for tracking student academic achievement.

With the ability to view, add, and modify grade entries for various subjects and assessment formats, the system allows users to maintain a structured database of student grades. Beyond simple data management, the analyzer identifies academic performance trends, such as recognizing high-achieving students, and computes performance indicators like average grades.

A key feature of this application is its reporting capabilities, which utilize statistical analysis and summary reports to transform raw grade data into insightful information. These reports help teachers recognize patterns and determine the best instructional strategies.

The Student Grade Analyzer addresses a real need in education and administration while demonstrating the practical application of programming principles through fundamental OOP concepts.
